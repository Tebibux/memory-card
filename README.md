# Memory Card Game App

Welcome to the Memory Card Game App! This app is a fun and challenging memory card game where players can test their memory skills and aim to match pairs of cards.

## About the Game

The Memory Card Game App is a React-based web application that allows players to play a classic memory card game. Players are presented with a grid of face-down cards. They can choose two cards at a time, attempting to match pairs with the same image. If the images match, the cards stay face-up; otherwise, they are flipped back down.

The game includes three levels of winning:

- **Expert**: Score 14 out of 17 cards.
- **Middle Player**: Score between 7 and 13 cards.
- **Practice**: Score less than 7 cards.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository: `git clone git@github.com:Tebibux/memory-card.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd memory-card`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Start the development server: `npm start`
5. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to play the game.

## How to Play

1. Click on a face-down card to reveal the image.
2. Click on a second face-down card to reveal its image.
3. If the images match, the cards will stay face-up. If not, the cards will flip back down.
4. Continue selecting pairs of cards until you've matched all the pairs.
